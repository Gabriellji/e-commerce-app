### Shops (buyer side)
I am a usual buyer user and I want to enjoy the design of the website because if its really good I will trust the company... if its messy, cluttered and looks weird I will never spend any money in there

Maximum of 10 items per page on a shop’s page so users with phone or PC with small screen can comfortably browse and don’t get confused by an unending list of items.

The shop’s page have to be simple, not cluttered and devoid of sponsored products, advertisement or suggestions of any kind. Our target demographic, more often than not, already knows exactly what product or service from what specific shop he or she is looking for. So, the reason to use our E-commerce app is to buy that specific item, it’s not just buy the “cheapest” pair of jeans from any random seller. Therefore, suggestion are intrusive and don’t bring any value.

As a corollary to the last bullet point, the buyer user may have issues locating the product inside the app (again, not selecting or deciding which one to buy) so a “search” functionality must be added inside each shop.

### Buying process
Give confirmation on every step of the buying process with clear explanation text. Examples:
- “Review the items you have selected here”
- “No purchase has been made yet”
- “Click here to proceed to the payment page”
