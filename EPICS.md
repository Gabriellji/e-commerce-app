# Epics
> These are the epics that we defined for the project. Because of time constraints and the actual scope of the exercise, we weren't able to do all of them but we believe it's interesting to see what was the full extent of our idea.

- As a buyer I want to be able to pay for the products I selected so I can buy them
- As a seller I want to access information about the payments I have received from my customers so I can use it for various purposes (accounting, marketing, inventory, etc.).
- As a buyer I want to be able to get customer service and after-sale service through the website, so I keep shopping in the same places I did before the pandemic.
- As a seller I want to access information about the buyers so I can give them after-sale service.
- As a buyer I want to be able to write reviews about the shops and their after-sales service so other potential shoppers can know what are the best stores.
- As a buyer I want to be able to log in to the webpage so I can have a more personalized experience.
- As a seller I want to be able to log in to the webpage so I can update and mantain my store and access useful information.
- As a seller I want to implement marketing strategies on my shop so I can sell more products and earn more money.
