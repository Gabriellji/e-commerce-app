## :seedling: Some history
We are 4 students of Wild Code School and at the moment these lines are being written, we are attending the "Web and mobile developer" bootcamp. This training program is 5 months long and is teaching us all the technical know-how and knowledge to develop interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, so we can take a React and Node JS development project to completion.

After learning the fundamentals of React, we were asked to team up and develop a simple web application with a few constraints. Basically, we had to use React for the user interface, use data that would be fetched from an API of our choosing and we had close to 48 hours of allotted time in our agendas distributed in two months of calendar time. Then, we were given free rein to do whatever kind of app that we wanted in whatever style we wanted.

Despite coming from different backgrounds and all over the world, we became friends very quickly, so we decided to form a team and work together for this project. After brainstorming and discussing, we ended up deciding to do a simple E-commerce web application following the current trends caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We actually dreamed up a whole narrative about us being a Scrum Team working for a fictional company called “Norris Inc.”, and how we were asked to create the web app following a line of reasoning explained in the “Unmet needs” sections.

The project went very well, we were able to work together with little to no conflict and we actually succeeded in creating the web app that we wanted. We also learned a lot, both in term of coding know-how and about working in a web development project. We started using Scrum for the project management and we even completed two short sprints but then we decided that it wasn't a good fit for us, as a team of students and for such a time frame. So, even if we all liked very much to work with Scrum, we decided to switch to Kanban for the final leg of the project. We don't expect to always be switching the project management approach but, in this case, we felt that it was justified and it's also quite normal for students to want to experiment new things.

All in all, it was a very fun project, we learned a lot from it, and we will all treasure the moments spent together working as a team. We hope that you will like it and if you have any questions, comments or you want to reach us, you can do so thru our Linked In profiles:

## :lock: Constraints
- Try to use Scrum as best as possible to manage the project.
- Must use React.
- It has to be some kind of web application that uses data coming from an API.
- Limited time: 2 months calendar but just ~40 effective hours.
- Only 4 students as developers, no Scrum Master and no Product Owner.

## :rugby_football: Scrum Team
We are Scrum team working under a fictional company called “Norris Inc.” that sells workwear through with a “direct-to-consumer” business model through an online E-commerce platform. The clothes are made by a third party to our specifications.

The company is located in a small but very populated European city (London) that also has a lot of offices and businesses. In this city there are a lot of environmental regulations that make having a big physical store unfeasible and unpractical. The better option is to ship directly to the consumer but, again, because of regulations and narrow streets it is not possible nor practical to use big trucks.

As a response, Norris Inc. has his own logistic and shipping system that utilizes small warehouses all around the city and a big network of delivery cyclist. Norris Inc. has won all the environmental and business design awards because of this.

## :question: Unmet needs
The COVID-19 pandemic has a lot of people confined in their homes. This has been going on for some time now and will not change on the foreseeable future because people in the city don’t trust Putin’s vaccine and also have taken a liking to stay at home with their cats, Netflix, wine, food and pajamas. This is exactly what has disrupted our business model. Simply put, our customers no longer have a need for work clothes to wear around the office because they are working from home in their cat hair covered pajamas.

The folks in the marketing department saw that we now have an underutilized logistic and shipping system and also that a lot of small shops owners around the city are trying to sell their products to customers that no longer go to their physical stores because they aren’t leaving their houses as much. These shops owner’s unmet need is our opportunity: Norris Inc. can provide the shipping service and charge for that.

But then there is a second unmet need. Turns out that a most of these local stores around town have always sold from physical locations and have never needed (or wanted) to sell online until now. The pandemic is forcing everyone to adapt to this new world where nobody leaves the house. So, here again, the folks from marketing saw an opportunity. Since Norris Inc. already knows how to sell online, because that is what we do, we can also help the stores around the city to do it. This basically means that we have to provide an E-commerce platform for these shops, and we can also charge for this.

A third unmet need is that a lot of these small shops around the city proud themselves in offering top-notch customer service and a lot of after-sale service. They do it because they have cultivated a very long relationship with their clients. There are a lot of cases where a clientele has been shopping for the same products in the same shop for years and years. So, if we want to host these shops under our E-commerce platform, we must also provide a way for the customer service and after-sale service to happen. We have been told that meeting this “need” is paramount to the success of the project.

## :walking: User personas
### Persona #1: Buyer
- 60 years old (old timer, old school).
- Born in pre-internet era (boomer).
- Does not know how to use technology very well so he / she has the habit of asking family members for help and calling customer service for assistance.
- Knows from eBay, Amazon, Etsy and other E-commerce websites from newspaper articles and younger family members and friends but does not uses them or cares about them particularly. He / she finds them too difficult to use, too crowded (information overload) and not user friendly specially because those sites don't have a number where you can call to get personalized assistance.
- Uses social media, particularly Facebook.
- Retiree so lots of disposable income (not particularly looking for good deals but for quality products and specific products that he / she likes for whatever reason).
- Has a credit card but also likes to pay cash and with checks.
- Struggles to use a smartphone.
- Has a smartphone but it maybe has a small screen or it's old.
- Also has a desktop / laptop PC but it's old one for Facebook, reading emails and archiving.
- Lives in the outskirts, probably in a posh city area with very good pedestrian infrastructure and local shops so he / she is used to a ~15 min leisurely walk to the local shops.
- Has been going to the same shops for 20 years so he / she still wants to keep buying from them
- Currently cannot leave the house because of quarantine.
- Still wants to shop on usual places but doesn't know how.

### Persona #2: Seller
Small local store, been there since forever.
Mom and pop store.
“Brick and mortar”.
Does not sell food or other perishable items.
Sells technology, clothes, toys, small electronics, small household appliances, etc. 
Because of pandemic I can't sell in person so to keep the business I need to sell online but I don't know how.
Provides a lot of after-sale service and customer service.
Has an established clientele.
Doesn't have warehouses or shipping service so there is trepidation about selling online.

## :brain: Explorations + Decisions
Talk a little about the brainstorm session, the JED session and the mock spring so to explain how the idea came to be.
