## :seedling: Some history
### Who are we?
We are [Yauheniya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeniya-gabrikova/), [Jacopo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopo-luri-1111081a2/),
[Mancini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mancia08/) and [Carlos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosaore/), 4 students of [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/). At the moment these lines are being written, we are attending a ["Web developer"](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB/trainings/web-developer-full-time) bootcamp that is 5 months long and is teaching us all the technical know-how and knowledge to develop interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, so we can take a React and Node JS development project to completion.

### Why did we create this?
After learning the fundamentals of React, we were asked to team up and develop a simple web application with a few constraints. Basically, we had to use React for the user interface, use data that would be fetched from an API of our choosing and we had close to 48 hours of allotted time in our agendas distributed in two months of calendar time. Other than that, we were given free rein to do whatever kind of app that we wanted in whatever style we wanted.

Despite coming from different backgrounds and from all over the world, we became friends very quickly, so we decided to form a team and work together for this project. After brainstorming and discussing, we ended up deciding to do a simple E-commerce web application following the current trends caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We actually dreamed up a whole narrative about us being a Scrum Team working for a fictional company called “Norris Inc.”, and how we were asked to create the web app following a line of reasoning explained in the “Unmet needs” sections.

### How was it?
The project went very well, we were able to work together with little to no conflict and we actually succeeded in creating the web app that we wanted. We also learned a lot, both in term of coding know-how and about working in a web development project. We started using Scrum for the project management and we even completed two short sprints but then we decided that it wasn't a good fit for us, as a team of students and for such a time frame. So, even if we all liked very much to work with Scrum, we decided to switch to Kanban for the final leg of the project. We don't expect to always be switching the project management approach but, in this case, we felt that it was justified and it's also quite normal for students to want to experiment new things.

All in all, it was a very fun project, we learned a lot from it, and we will all treasure the moments spent together working as a team. We hope that you will like it and if you have any questions, comments or you want to reach us, you can do so thru our Linked In profiles:

## :lock: Constraints
- Use Scrum as best as possible to manage the project.
- Must use React.
- It has to be some kind of web application that uses data coming from an API.
- Time-boxed: 2 months of calendar time but actually just ~48 effective hours.
- Only 4 students as developers, no Scrum Master, no Product Owner and no specific boundaries other than the constraint stated above.

## :rugby_football: Scrum Team
We are pretending to be a Scrum team working under a fictional company called “Norris Inc.” that sells workwear through with a “direct-to-consumer” business model through an online E-commerce platform. The clothes are made by a third party to our specifications.

The company is located in a small but very populated European city (London) that has a lot of offices and businesses. In this city there are a lot of environmental regulations that make having a big physical store unfeasible and unpractical. The better option is to ship directly to the consumer but, again, because of regulations and narrow streets it is not possible nor practical to use big trucks.

As a response, Norris Inc. has his own logistic and shipping system that utilizes small warehouses all around the city and a big network of delivery cyclist. Norris Inc. has won all the environmental and business design awards because of this.

## :question: Unmet needs
The COVID-19 pandemic has a lot of people confined in their homes. This has been going on for some time now and will not change on the foreseeable future because people in the city don’t trust Putin’s vaccine and also have taken a liking to stay at home with their cats, Netflix, wine, food and pajamas. This is exactly what has disrupted our business model. Simply put, our customers no longer have a need for work clothes to wear around the office because they are working from home in their cat hair covered pajamas.

The folks in the marketing department saw that we now have an underutilized logistic and shipping system and also that a lot of small shops owners around the city are trying to sell their products to customers that no longer go to their physical stores because they aren’t leaving their houses as much. These shops owner’s unmet need is our opportunity: Norris Inc. can provide the shipping service and charge for that.

But then there is a second unmet need. Turns out that a most of these local stores around town have always sold from physical locations and have never needed (or wanted) to sell online until now. The pandemic is forcing everyone to adapt to this new world where nobody leaves the house. So, here again, the folks from marketing saw an opportunity. Since Norris Inc. already knows how to sell online, because that is what we do, we can also help the stores around the city to do it. This basically means that we have to provide an E-commerce platform for these shops, and we can also charge for this.

A third unmet need is that a lot of these small shops around the city proud themselves in offering top-notch customer service and a lot of after-sale service. They do it because they have cultivated a very long relationship with their clients. There are a lot of cases where a clientele has been shopping for the same products in the same shop for years and years. So, if we want to host these shops under our E-commerce platform, we must also provide a way for the customer service and after-sale service to happen. We have been told that meeting this “need” is paramount to the success of the project.

## :walking: User personas
### Persona #1: Buyer
- 60 years old (old timer, old school).
- Born in pre-internet era (boomer?).
- Does not know how to use technology that well so he / she has the habit of asking family members for help and calling customer service for assistance and guidance.
- Knows about eBay, Amazon, Etsy and other E-commerce websites from newspaper articles and other family members and friends but does not use them or cares about them particularly. He / she finds them too difficult to use, too crowded (information overload) and not user friendly specially because those sites don't have a number where you can call to get personalized assistance.
- Uses social media, particularly Facebook.
- He or she is a retiree so lots of disposable income (translation: not particularly looking for good deals but for quality products and specific products that he / she likes for whatever reason).
- Has a credit card but also likes to pay cash and to give tips.
- Struggles to use a smartphone.
- Has a smartphone but maybe with a small screen or it's an old model.
- Also has a desktop / laptop PC but it's old one with a small screen that is used primarly for Facebook and emails.
- Lives in the outskirts, probably in a posh city area with very good pedestrian infrastructure and local shops so he / she is used to a ~15 min leisurely walk to the local shops.
- Has been going to the same shops for 20 years so he / she still wants to keep buying from them
- Currently cannot leave the house because of quarantine.
- Still wants to shop on usual places but doesn't know how.

### Persona #2: Seller
- Small local store, been there since forever.
- Mom and pop store.
- “Brick and mortar”.
- Does not sell food or other perishable items.
- Sells technology, clothes, toys, small electronics, small household appliances, etc. 
- Because of pandemic I can't sell in person so to keep the business I need to sell online but I don't know how.
- Provides a lot of after-sale service and customer service.
- Has an established clientele.
- Doesn't have warehouses or shipping service so there is trepidation about selling online.

## :brain: Explorations + Decisions
### Brainstorming
Since we were given very broad guidelines, we had to spend some time deciding what we want to do and how. During our initial brainstorm meeting we kept circling back to an E-commerce application that would be used to sell something: flights? trips? clothes? pet food, supplies, and services? This was done in a conference call using a google jamboard for quickly jotting down ideas.

On a second meeting we decided to try and figure out what would be out motivation, or justification for the project, which meant that we had to also figure out who we are in this scenario. This is where things started to get interesting and the idea kind of revealed itself to us (not unlike in a Scrum managed project, mind you). Then, we did a Joint Application Development (JAD) session to clearly define the need for the project (benefits, opportunities, problems, risks, etc.) and the scope (constraints, assumptions, success factors, etc.). We used the same tools as last time.

Finally, just to “iron out the details”, we met again and made some critical decisions about the personas that the project would be targeting, laid out epics and user stories and we prioritized them using the MoSCow methodology. For this we switched to google slides and mira. All of this sound like a lot of work but it actually took place in the span of two days and it allowed us to work with very clear objectives and purposes.

### Scrum
When it was time to begin to work, we realized that we were not completely comfortable with Scrum so after talking about it we decided run what we called a “mock sprint” with one team member acting as a "Scrum Master" and another one as a "Product Owner".

This "mock sprint" basically was a Sprint with a very small set of user stories that could be done in a couple of days. We started working without expecting very much of the result but trying to pay attention to the impediments and other kind of issue. This ended up being a very smart decision because it allowed us to see some fundamental issues with our project idea and correct our workflow and behavior to better match the agile [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

With the lessons learned from the “mock sprint” (laid out in a retrospective meeting), we quickly did a sprint planning session, poker planning, etc. and we started to work with complete confidence in our idea. This actually worked so well that the only real impediment we had from that point forward was scrum itself. The cost of adhering to the ceremonies, user story format, etc. started to be bigger than the benefits we were getting. In the context of the bootcamp, this project is supposed to be a learning tool before getting to more serious projects. That’s why the allotted time was very short.

### The big change
At the end of that second sprint we decided to experiment with a leaner and faster project management approach. In truth, we were hesitant to do such a drastic change in the middle of the project, but we also believed that, as students, we are supposed to try and experiment so we can learn from different sources. Also, it could be argued that we were organically following agile principle, welcoming change, simplicity, result oriented, etc. Again, this decision proved to be good because we started to work a lot faster.

### Tools
We used Jira as our main tool to assist in the project management and Confluence to store and access all the documentation being produced (master project document, meeting notes, design guidelines, etc.), Slack together with Google Meet as our platform for communication.

In the final stages of the project we asked our fellow students for feedback so we could fix any small bugs or UI issues that were still present. Having met the critical success factors, the web application was done. We still wanted to add more features, as per all the epics that we created, but we didn’t have anymore time and we also had already surpassed the expectation for the exercise. All in all, we really enjoyed working in this project and as a team, we learned a lot and we are excited about our future as developers.

## :construction_worker: Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
